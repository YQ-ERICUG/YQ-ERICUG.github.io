      <description>![](http://eqseis.geosc.psu.edu/~cammon/HTML/Classes/IntroQuakes/Notes/Images_specific02/seis_amp.gif)  Magnitude was the first quantitative measure of earthquake size based on seismograms. The maximum or &amp;ldquo;peak&amp;rdquo; ground motion is defined as the largest absolute value of ground motion recorded on a seismogram.
 Taking the 2011-03-11 Tohoku great earthquake as an example, at first, download broad-band seismic data in vertical direction from the global seismic stations (GSN) using Web Service Fetch scripts, and then convert data format from miniseed to SAC with software mseed2sac.</description>

      <description>Now, all the preparations have been done. Let&amp;rsquo;s start the key part of back-projection.
 We often cross correlate waveforms in a relatively lower frequency band, and then crosse correlate for a higher frequency bands again. This two-step procedure gives a good high-frequency station correction and avoids errors that may be caused by cycle slip in the higher frequencies.
Copy all seismic files that have been checked in the Chapter 2, make sure that there are not repeating stations and all files have an equal delta.</description>
